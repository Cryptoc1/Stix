# OSam

I *very* minimal operating system, kind of.

#### why?
Not only do I feel that this project is a great way for me to practice my Assembly programming, but the goal of this project
is help me understand the booting process of a computer. This os isn't going to include fancy features like protected mode
or advanced segmentation, or high level system APIs, but will allow me to learn more about the underlying concepts for 
practice. I mean, come on, it's not like I'll ever actually have to right my own OS... Right?
